Data supporting my submission to JEB

The provided data sets support figures 1, 2 & 4. However, figure 1 is not truley quantitaive and therefore was created in a different software.
The latter is supported by timing of spawning.csv file. 

The figures here can be also found in the full MS that was submited. 

Tble S1 should be added to the manuscrip as supplementry data, if published.
